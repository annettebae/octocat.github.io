Welcome to Annette's Github page! 

I am currently a sophomore in Korea University, majoring in International Studies. 
This page is where I will record my **recent obsessions**, and **review on films**. 

# recent obsession
_Top Gun: Maverick_ : A film directed by Joseph Kosinski, a sequel to Top Gun (1986). Features **Tom Cruise** (Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell), **Miles Teller** (Bradely 'Rooster' Bradshaw), **Glenn Powell** (Jake 'Hangman' Seresin), **Jennifer Connelley** (Penny Benjamin), etc. As a sequel made 36 years after the original film, the critics are blown by the iconic scenes spectacularly homaged. For example, beach volleyball scene has been re-made with One Republic's _<I Ain't Worried>_, and Tom Cruise drives along the Californian highway on his old Kawasaki. The soundtracks from 1986 have also been re-inserted after being slightly eidted by Hans Zimmer and Harold Faltermeyer.
